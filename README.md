# FD-Viz
## Shiny app for flash drought visualisation

This is a shiny-R application to visualise flash drought time series in central Europe. The data sets used are from FLUXNET2015 stations and the respective pixels from ERA5. The multiple identification methods were implemented using the package fdClassify (https://github.com/pedroalencar1/fdClassify).
